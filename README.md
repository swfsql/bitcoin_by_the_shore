A WIP technical presentation about Bitcoin for non-technical people.

The presentation is being drawn on draw.io.  
It doesn't have any textual information on it except the title, so it's fairly applicable for other languages.

After the drawn material is done they'll be exported into various formats,
such as pdf and the original sourced draw.io html, and made available as a supplementary material,
which may also be used for ones own's personal editing/distribution.

The file notes.md will be used during the presentation screen casting,
which will be recorded and also made available.  
Then the notes will be removed.

The presentation will be in portuguese. One version will have backgorund music, but a hidden version will be available without the music - a link to it will be available in the video's description.

Then there will be work on a transcription - in portuguese - and then an english translation from it.  
Then anyone may translate the subs to their own language if they want to.
They may also record their own presentations or use any parts of it, including it's totality, on the original or modified material, as they see fit.

Also, after the english translation are added as subs, a work is planned for an appendix,
linking all relevant terms from the analogies into the official terms.
But such appendix may not be screencasted and be just a supplementary material instead.

It's possible for the spoken english presentation to be screencasted by myself, but it would be of poorer quality. Other may also prefer to present or screencast in portuguese itself, if they feel like it.
Those material will be referenced on the description as well as long as it doesn't have crude mistakes or defamation and stuff like that.

Other future work possibility are discussions and explanations about forks, Lightning Network and also the MimbleWimble transaction protocol.
